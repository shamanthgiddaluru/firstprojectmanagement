Using GitHub's project management features—milestones, issues, and project boards—can  enhance team collaboration and project organization. These tools provide a structured approach to tracking progress, assigning tasks, and identifying potential bugs.
Milestones are used for setting goals and deadlines, giving the team a clear understanding of what needs to be achieved and by when. This helps keep the project on track and provides motivation to complete in time.
Issues allow teams to document and categorize tasks, bugs, and feature requests in a detailed manner.  Assigning issues to specific team members ensures accountability, and using labels (such as "bug," "enhancement," or "task") helps everyone quickly identify the type of issue at hand. 
Project boards are excellent for visualizing progress. They help teams see the status of various tasks at a glance, whether in the "To Do," "In Progress," or "Done" stages, creating a streamlined workflow.
